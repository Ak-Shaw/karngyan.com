<b><span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:4em">In</span></b> <span style="font-family:'Courier New', monospace;">*a matter of opinion, what makes a great app? Is it the service or the fun it offers? Is it its ergonomics, its visual aspect? Why do you love some applications? Is it because they never crash? It is because their interface uses your language? Is it because they store or do not store personal data?*</span>

> <span style="font-family:'metronova';">What makes a great app? The first and foremost thing in the entire upcoming discussion will be the user experience, which comes with the UI/UX design. The look of the app should be soothing to the eye and its functioning, whatever it may provide, must be as smooth as possible.</span>

> <span style="font-family:'metronova';">The first priority of what makes a good app is quite subjective though.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Brush Script MT', cursive; font-size:2em">The best example in this regard will be a dialog from one of the episodes of Silicon Valley where Monica tells Richard that ‚Äúit looks so engineered‚Äù. For those who may not know, Silicon Valley is an American comedy television series which focuses on five young men who found a startup company in Silicon Valley. The context of the same, Monica‚Äôs words, was that the company of Richard, Pied Piper, had launched the beta version of their platform and the people behind the platform shared it with their friends. Now the friends of coders were fellow coders. Technically speaking they shared the platform to only coders, none of the non-engineering groups, so all the opinions came from the engineering class stating that it was one of the best platforms they‚Äôve ever seen. Monica was the only one of the non-engineering class who received the invite of giving her take on the platform, but on hearing that almost everyone was cheering with how awesome was the platform, she stepped down, unknowing that all the reviews were coming from engineers.</span>

> <span style="font-family:'Courier New', monospace;">So, the functioning is obviously important, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that it has more priority to the design. Typically that‚Äôs the take by users, the non-engineering class. The coders, on the other hand, are always more concerned with the functioning of the app, the reason being why ***designers are as important as developers and hence should be given recognition none the less than that of a developer***.</span>
